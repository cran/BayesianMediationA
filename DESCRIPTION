Description: We perform general mediation analysis in the Bayesian setting using the methods described in Yu and Li (2022, ISBN:9780367365479). With the package, the mediation analysis can be performed on different types of outcomes (e.g., continuous, binary, categorical, or time-to-event), with default or user-defined priors and predictive models. The Bayesian estimates and credible sets of mediation effects are reported as analytic results.
